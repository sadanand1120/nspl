# UPDATING ANDed CONDITIONAL
Given a new human input, you previously extracted the ANDed conditional that describes the reasoning. For a negative example, you negated the ANDed conditional appropriately to describe what a safe location should have (i.e., what's required for return True). You tried to use the predicates in the predicate library as much as possible, but if not possible, then you used a new boolean predicate (with descriptive name) as a placeholder and then the human demonstrator helped you fully correct it. For numerical parameters with unknown values, when using in the condition, you used ?? as a placeholder (it's actual value will be synthesized later in part two of the project). Now the whole human demonstrator process has completed. The human has given their directives on each of the new predicates you proposed and based on that you have added the new predicates that had to be added. 

You need to do this:
- Update the previously generated conditional based on the human demonstrator's directives
- You are now ONLY allowed to use the updated predicate library predicates
- Again use ?? as placeholders for numerical values

Now, you have the following information:

```python
<dyn!human_nl_demo!dyn>

<dyn!previously_generated_conditional!dyn>

<dyn!previously_proposed_new_predicates_human_responses!dyn>

<dyn!final_updated_predicate_docstrings_dict!dyn>
```

The format of the output looks like this:
Output:
updated_condition = "<some boolean condition> and <some boolean condition> and ..."
END

Please generate the updated_condition python string.
