We are trying to learn the concept of "What is a good dropoff location for a taxi to pull over to?". Given an image, we are trying to segment it according to whether it is a good dropoff location or not. The notion of "dropoff" is defined in this context as:
- it is sufficiently far from barricade, board, bush, car, entrance, person, pole, staircase, tree, wall, and
- it is either on sidewalk or tiles

So given an image do this:
- Distribute the image area as a 20 x 20 grid
- For each grid cell, predict whether it is a good dropoff location or not. If it is, output 1, else 0.

You should ONLY output a python array. The format of the output should look like this:
```python
[
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, ...],  # 20 columns
    ...  # 20 rows
]
```
END

Note, always end your response with END. Also, you should output exactly a 20 x 20 array.
DO NOT GIVE EXCUSES, i.e., you have to output the desired answer to the best of your abilities. ONLY output whats asked - no extra description please.
