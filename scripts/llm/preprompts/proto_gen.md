# GENERATE PROTOTYPE and DOCSTRINGS for new predicates
Assume you have access to all the fundamental predicates as well as the predicate library:

```python
<dyn!predicate_docstrings_dict!dyn>
```

and that you are capable of using them. Now, from the new human demonstration input, you previously have extracted some new predicates and the human demonstrator has explained their meaning to you / given certain corrective actions.

Based on this, you need to basically do three things:
1) Decide which new predicates you really require, i.e., out of the list of new predicates you put forward to the human, see if the human has directed to merge any or remove any (as they were not required in the first place)
2) Generate the corrected full prototype (i.e., with the correct arguments, their types, and the return type) for each of the new predicates
3) Generate the docstrings for these new predicates
You need to output a dictionary (it can be empty, if needed) of the following format:

Output:
```python
new_docstrings_dict = {
    <full prototype for predicate>: <docstring for predicate>,
    ...
}
```
END

## Examples
Example:
<Assume predicate library has is_far_from(...)>
<Assume the explanation dict had "is_too_close_to(...)" mapped to human's response as "Means the location is not far enough from the object_class">
Output:
```python
new_docstrings_dict = {
    "is_too_close_to(pixel_loc: Tuple[int, int], object_class: str, alpha: float) -> bool": "Returns True if the pixel location is not far from, according to the parameter, the nearest object of the object_class",
}
```
END

Now, given the following explanation dict:
```python
<dyn!explanation!dyn>
```
please generate the desired python dictionary.
