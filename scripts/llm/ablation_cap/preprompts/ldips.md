# CONVERTING the PROGRAM SKETCH for is_safe to another form
You have generated the program sketch from the human NL input. Now, you need to convert the program sketch to another form. In the new form, each of the boolean predicates you are using need to be converted to a standardised form as described below.

<!concept_specific_ldips_states!>

Note, the names of predicates and states, etc, have meaning. So use it smartly and convert the sketch to the desired form.

The format of the output looks like:
Output:
```python
<converted program sketch>
```
END

Given the following program sketch:
```python
<dyn!current_program_sketch!dyn>
```
Please convert it to the desired form.
